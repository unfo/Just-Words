<p>My colleague and I have been both wondering about this: why do the big media companies &#8211; such as <a href="http://www.riaa.com/default.asp"><span class="caps">RIAA</span></a> and its counterparts in other countries &#8211; seem to devote their full attention to anti-piracy (e.g. lobbying for laws that make normal end-user&#8217;s everyday life harder and nearer to the side of illegal) instead of providing the masses with better service?</p>

<p>My point is that currently &#8211; to my knowledge &#8211; <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">Apple iTunes Music Store</a> is the only place online where you can buy digital versions of episodes of your favourite tv-series (e.g. <a href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/lost/">Lost</a> ).
And unfortunately, as with music, the variety of tv-series available for download in the iTunes Store is still quite marginal. But! It is the on the right path. It is providing people online with an alternative to downloading those episodes illegally &#8211; for those of us who do not live in the <span class="caps">USA</span> and therefore are out of reach of these brand new tv-series.</p>
<p>So why aren&#8217;t companies like <a href="http://www.nbc.com/"><span class="caps">NBC</span></a> and <a href="http://www.cbs.com/"><span class="caps">CBS</span></a> and their comrades doing anything to feed this hunger for internet sales?</p>
<p>Beats me.</p>
<p>I can tell you one thing: if I could get every episode of <a href="http://www.nbc.com/The_Tonight_Show_with_Jay_Leno/">The Tonight Show with Jay Leno</a> for, say, $5 per episode within 24hrs of the original air date, then I&#8217;d spend 52&#215;5 x $5 = $1300 / year on that show alone. Not to mention the over half a dozen other tv shows I&#8217;d be willing to pay for.</p>
<p>From a few online bittorrent-sites I can check that there are at least 10 downloads per Tonight Show episode (usually around 50+), which would make with rough math $13.000 losses in sales each year. And these are only a few sites. I know of dozens of bittorrent sites solely specialised in tv shows.</p>
<p>I know all internet users are not like me &#8211; willing to spend their hard earned currency on something that can be stolen, but even if out of 50 you get 10 or 5 that are willing to pay it&#8217;d still be extra money.</p>
<p>Of course the companies have to take a little risk on whether the income generated by the download quantities can cover the cost of the bandwidth, but look at iTunes &#8211; I very much doubt it will be going anywhere any time soon.</p>
