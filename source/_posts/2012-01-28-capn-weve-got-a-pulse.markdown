# The winds of change and so forth

Having written my first snippet of HTML 3.2 back in '96 and then after a few years of hand-written html/css and some quirky js I was taught some php and mysql by a new friend and thenceforth I have been programming almost exclusively for the web. I've done php, python, c#/asp.net, ruby/rails, java, javascript/node.js and groovy/grails. A lot of different experiences and ways to build a wheel - but I've invented that wheel quite a few times now.

I am now taking a step away from web development, even tho' the field is full of potential and it is changing at such a rapid pace it would probably be prudent to stick with it and especially master javascript as it is surfacing as the generalist language with which you can do almost anything.
