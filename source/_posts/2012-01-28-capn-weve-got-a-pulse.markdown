$ sudo make me a blog

Having written my first snippet of HTML 3.2 back in '96 and then after a few years of hand-written html/css and some quirky js I was learned some php and mysql from [Sami Honkonen](http://www.samihonkonen.fi/) and thenceforth I have been programming almost exclusively for the web. I've done php, python, c#/asp.net, ruby/rails, java, javascript/node.js and groovy/grails. A lot of different experiences and ways to build a wheel - but I've invented that wheel quite a few times now.

I am now taking a step away from web development, even tho' the field is full of potential and it is changing at such a rapid pace it would probably be prudent to stick with it and especially master javascript as it is surfacing as the generalist language with which you can do almost anything.

Regardless of the fruit that could be reaped in this field, I feel as though I need to try something new. This is just a matter of personal development and finding interesting challenges.
